## Sources

The content of these docs is originally drawn from original experience
with the software, as well as

- http://open-zfs.org/
- https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/wiki/

Original attempts included content from the OpenZFS man pages; but the
man pages are licensed under the CDDL. This documentation is licensed
under [CC BY-SA 3.0][1], in keeping with the example on the upstream
OpenZFS wikis.

Similarly, I can't draw directly from [Aaron Toponce's
documentation][2], which uses [CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 US][3], a more restrictive
license that prohibits commercial use.
